---
This app was developed for sharing data regarding studies on the internal quantum yield of UCNPs.
For more information on the mathematical modelling check the following paper: (Coming soon!)

This is a virtual lab to test how different parameters of UCNP compounds affect
the population densities, luminescence and internal quantum yield of the energy levels of the rare-earth elements embedded in the host matrix.

Navigate to the `simulation` tab in the sidebar and play with the parameters available there.

Enjoy!
