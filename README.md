# Virtual Lab APP for UCNPs (Beta)

This application is a GUI to enable quick check on the behaviour of UCNPs for
different energy transfer and decay rates.
The app uses a mathematical model developed based on rate-equations presented in a paper recently submitted for publication.

The online version of it can be accessed [here](https://jsmatias-qy-virtuallabapp-home-ch3fhq.streamlit.app/)
